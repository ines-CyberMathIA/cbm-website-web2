MongoDB CRUD Operations

CRUD operations create, read, update, and delete documents.

You can connect with driver methods and perform CRUD operations for deployments hosted in the following environments:

You can perform CRUD operations in the UI for deployments hosted in MongoDB Atlas.
Create Operations

Create or insert operations add new documents to a collection. If the collection does not currently exist, insert operations will create the collection.

MongoDB provides the following methods to insert documents into a collection:

    db.collection.insertOne()

    db.collection.insertMany()

In MongoDB, insert operations target a single collection. All write operations in MongoDB are atomic on the level of a single document.
The components of a MongoDB insertOne operations.

For examples, see Insert Documents.
Read Operations

Read operations retrieve documents from a collection; i.e. query a collection for documents. MongoDB provides the following methods to read documents from a collection:

    db.collection.find()

You can specify query filters or criteria that identify the documents to return.
The components of a MongoDB find operation.

For examples, see:

    Query Documents

    Query on Embedded/Nested Documents

    Query an Array

    Query an Array of Embedded Documents

Update Operations

Update operations modify existing documents in a collection. MongoDB provides the following methods to update documents of a collection:

    db.collection.updateOne()

    db.collection.updateMany()

    db.collection.replaceOne()

In MongoDB, update operations target a single collection. All write operations in MongoDB are atomic on the level of a single document.

You can specify criteria, or filters, that identify the documents to update. These filters use the same syntax as read operations.
The components of a MongoDB updateMany operation.

For examples, see Update Documents.
Delete Operations

Delete operations remove documents from a collection. MongoDB provides the following methods to delete documents of a collection:

    db.collection.deleteOne()

    db.collection.deleteMany()

In MongoDB, delete operations target a single collection. All write operations in MongoDB are atomic on the level of a single document.

You can specify criteria, or filters, that identify the documents to remove. These filters use the same syntax as read operations.
The components of a MongoDB deleteMany operation.

For examples, see Delete Documents.
Bulk Write

MongoDB provides the ability to perform write operations in bulk. For details, see Bulk Write Operations.
